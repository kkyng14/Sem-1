Software Engineering
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course is designed to give students an introduction to an engineering approach in the
development of high-quality software systems. It will discuss the important software engineering
concepts in the various types of the common software process models. The students will also
learn the concepts and techniques used in each software development phase including
requirements engineering, software design and software testing. This course will also expose the
students to utilizing object-oriented method (e.g. UML) and tools in analyzing and designing the
software. At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to appreciate most of the
common software engineering concepts and techniques as well as producing various software
artifacts and deliverables.
