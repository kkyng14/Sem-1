Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers,
robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the students to digital
electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components, and tools.
Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts to
programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with the
simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom
